//! # jcode-micro-compact
//!
//! Micro-compaction clears old tool results before each API call without
//! performing full compaction (summarization).
//!
//! ## Purpose
//!
//! When the context window is large but not yet at the compaction threshold,
//! old tool results (file reads, bash output, grep results) consume tokens
//! that the assistant is unlikely to reference again. Micro-compaction
//! replaces those results with short placeholder messages, reclaiming tokens
//! without the cost of an LLM summarization call.
//!
//! ## How it works
//!
//! 1. **Token estimation** -- estimate how many tokens each message consumes.
//! 2. **Compactable tool identification** -- find tool results that are safe
//!    to replace (Read, Bash, Grep, etc.).
//! 3. **Time-based trigger** -- skip MC if a fresh cache already exists.
//! 4. **Cached MC path** -- remember which blocks were compacted so the next
//!    turn can skip already-processed content.
