## Status update (2026-10-17)

Since this draft was first authored:

- **§24 (XJ-03 portal MCP bridge) — UNBLOCKED.** The Spotify Portal admin
  allow-list already contains the Jcode CIMD's `client_id`. The CIMD's
  `redirect_uri` is loopback (`http://127.0.0.1:47290/oauth/callback`),
  which is allowed by Spotify Portal's default ("HTTP loopback redirects
  on localhost, 127.0.0.1, and [::1], using any port and path"). The
  operator can deploy the bridge by editing one placeholder in
  `scripts/portal-mcp-bridge.json` and merging into `~/.jcode/mcp.json`.
  No vendor action needed for XJ-03.
- **XJ-07 (verify failure and rollback) — IN FLIGHT** (subagent
  dispatched 2026-10-17T22:32Z, 30m budget). Jcode-side only.
- **XJ-02, XJ-04, XJ-05 — STILL BLOCKED on `@chirp/squab`.** These are
  the items this message is asking about. The Jcode side has done all it
  can. The squab side is the only remaining dependency.

The questions below are unchanged from the original draft.

## Short version (paste this)

Subject: Request for a custom coding-agent harness registration contract in Xirp

Hello,

I maintain Jcode, an open-source ACP-compliant coding agent. I would like to
register Jcode as a first-class custom harness in Xirp, alongside the five
vendors that ship with `@chirp/squab` 0.11.11 (`claude`, `codex`, `gemini`,
`pi`, `cursor`).

What I have found so far on the installed build (`xirp 0.49.0+app.db5402dc7`,
`/Applications/Xirp.app/Contents/Resources/app.asar`):

- `squab --available-harnesses` returns a fixed catalog of 5 harnesses. Jcode
  is absent.
- `xirp api send agents:list` returns the same 5 entries, all
  `"visibility": "public"`, all with hard-coded per-agent flags
  (`--launch-claude`, `--launch-codex`, etc.).
- The daemon message catalog (`xirp api list`) only exposes mutators
  (`harness:install|update|uninstall`) that act on harnesses already in the
  fixed catalog. There is no `harness:register` or `agents:create`.

What I would like to know:

1. **Is there a supported way to register a custom harness** (e.g., Jcode)
   without forking `@chirp/squab`?
2. If not, would Spotify accept a **generic ACP client adapter** in
   `@chirp/squab` so any ACP-compliant agent can be registered via a single
   config entry? ACP is a stable open spec and the Jcode side already
   implements it.
3. If neither is supported today, is a **vendor extension contract** (e.g.,
   an internal `@chirp/squab` plugin API) on the roadmap? If so, what
   timeline?

A full evidence dossier is in the Jcode repository at
`docs/XIRP_CUSTOM_HARNESS.md` (referenced from PR `KooshaPari/KCode#103`).
The dossier includes probe output, message-catalog enumeration, and an
honest record of one withdrawn sub-question (a session-list artifact that
turned out to be a project-registration issue, not a squab bug).

If the right channel for this is not direct email, I am happy to file it
wherever you prefer (issue tracker, customer support form, etc.). Please
let me know the channel and I will re-route.

Thank you for your time.

— Koosha Pari

## Full evidence dossier

The Jcode repository has a full evidence dossier at
`docs/XIRP_CUSTOM_HARNESS.md` in `KooshaPari/Jcode` master. The dossier
covers:

- XJ-01 (closed): no custom-harness registration contract exists at the
  current build. Evidence: 5 lines of cross-confirmation (squab
  --available-harnesses, xirp api send agents:list, daemon message catalog,
  AppBundle inspection, cross-checked against published docs).
- XJ-02 through XJ-07: blocked pending the answer to (1)-(3) above.
- Sub-question (g) (withdrawn): an earlier session-list artifact that
  appeared to be a squab bug turned out to be a project-registration issue
  on the Jcode side. Withdrawn rather than filed as a defect.

PR `KooshaPari/KCode#103` is a draft PR that captures the full
audit-correction arc; the body of that PR is the most recent summary of
what was learned.

## Operator action required

**I do not have a verified Spotify / Xirp contact channel from the agent
side.** xirp has no `feedback`/`support`/`contact` subcommand, the AppBundle
does not advertise a support URL, and the user-facing docs
(`https://backstage.spotify.com/docs/xirp`) do not list a contact email.
Past contact (if any) is not in agent knowledge.

The operator should:

1. Pick a channel (e.g., direct email, Spotify support form, GitHub
   issues on a public squab repo, etc.).
2. Paste the "Short version" above into that channel.
3. Send.

Or, if the operator has a prior contact at Spotify, paste the short
version into a reply to that thread.

## Channel options (2026-10-17 subagent investigation)

The `vendor-contact-search` subagent
(`session_mizaru_1792219502394_01b378b9830eb204`) was dispatched to find
a real contact channel and exhausted the following paths. **No public
contact channel exists for Xirp.** The product is Spotify-internal:

- `CFBundleIdentifier = "com.spotify.xirp"`, author = "Spotify"
- Internal codebase: `ghe.spotify.net` (Spotify's GitHub Enterprise;
  not externally accessible)
- Update CDN: `https://reckless-finch.spotifycdn.com/external/`
- `@chirp/*` packages (squab, daemon, etc.) are private (not on npm)
- No public GitHub repo for any `@chirp` package
- The Xirp CLI has no `feedback`/`support`/`contact` subcommand
- The Xirp AppBundle does not advertise a support URL
- `backstage.spotify.com/docs/xirp` does not list a contact email
- Web search for "Spotify Xirp developer support" returns no relevant hits

**Operator channel options, ranked by practicality:**

1. **Personal Slack/email to a Spotify contact** (Xirp team, Portal
   team, developer-relations, or any colleague with Xirp visibility).
   The operator is a `Portal Admins` member per STATE.md §B6, so
   internal channels are accessible. **This is the recommended path.**
2. **GitHub issue on a public squab/Xirp repo** — but no public repo
   exists, so this is not a real option. (Documented for completeness.)
3. **Direct email to a guessed-but-not-verified address** — the operator
   must verify before sending; the agent will not fabricate an address.
4. **Xirp app's built-in `update` flow** — the app has a built-in
   updater; the operator could in principle include a message with an
   update log. Not a real support channel, but documents the
   investigation exhaustively.

**Once a channel is chosen, paste the "Short version" verbatim from
the section above. Do not edit the questions — they were tuned against
the XJ-01 negative result and the 5-line proof in
`docs/XIRP_CUSTOM_HARNESS.md`.**

## Status update (2026-10-17)

§24 — all 3 unblock conditions for XJ-03 were marked resolved on
2026-10-17T07:14Z. The orchestrator's `scripts/portal-mcp-bridge.json`
was re-verified live (2026-10-17T22:46Z) against the production CIMD
URL. The verification **contradicted the prior unblock claim** —
`auth.kooshapari.com` is NXDOMAIN at the Cloudflare authoritative NS
and at 1.1.1.1 / 8.8.8.8; `https://kooshapari.com/oauth/client-metadata.json`
returns 404. The bridge mechanism itself passes (`mcp-remote@0.15.1`
correctly derives loopback port 47290 and emits a valid authorize URL).
Arg-order defect in the bridge config was fixed in commit
`39f2ea76f` (2026-10-18T01:25Z). The DNS / Cloudflare Worker
re-deploy is the operator's only remaining step for XJ-03; XJ-07
is shipped to master. XJ-02, XJ-04, XJ-05 are still blocked on
the @chirp/squab answers below.

## Status update (2026-10-18T01:25Z)

XJ-07 (failure and rollback verification) shipped to master at
`530511a66` + `c79951b05` on 2026-10-17. §24.2 captures the bridge
arg-order fix at `39f2ea76f` on 2026-10-18T01:25Z. The §24
"all 3 unblocked" claim is now superseded by §24.1 + §24.2 — the
defect was real (NXDOMAIN) and is being addressed (mock CIMD in
flight on `feat/xj03-mock-cimd-as-20261017`).

A targeted audit (`XJ-AUDIT-2026-10-17.md`, 77 lines) recommends
**three new vendor questions (Q4–Q6)** that close the
Q2/Q3-specificity gap. They are listed in the "Short version"
supplement below. If the operator chooses to send, paste both the
Short version (Q1–Q3) and the Q4–Q6 supplement as a single thread.

## Supplement: Q4–Q6 (per-item mapping)

These three additions close the Q2/Q3-specificity gap noted in
`XJ-AUDIT-2026-10-17.md` §"Vendor question quality check". Each
question is mapped 1:1 to a bounded work item so the vendor can
return an answer tied to a concrete interface or schema.

### Q4 — `AgentSessionAdapter` interface for a sixth harness (XJ-02, XJ-04, XJ-05)

> For the five harnesses that ship with `@chirp/squab` 0.11.11
> (`claude`, `codex`, `gemini`, `pi`, `cursor`), can you share the
> TypeScript interface (or schema) that each harness implements?
> Specifically, I would like to know the shape of
> `sessionRoot(cwd)`, `locateLatest`, `findBySessionId`,
> `readNative` / `writeNative`, `resumeArgs`, the turn-state
> detector, and the launchable-spec. Jcode will implement against
> this and upstream the patch.
>
> *Why:* XJ-02 (register Jcode as a sixth harness), XJ-04 (map
> working / waiting / idle / failed / completed states), and
> XJ-05 (transcript round-trip) are blocked solely on this
> unmeasured interface.
>
> *Expected response:* pasted interface/schema, or a named doc
> path; or "spec is internal, cannot share".

### Q5 — Usage / cost extraction contract (XJ-06)

> Which usage fields must an adapter expose for `@chirp/squab` to
> accept it? At minimum, input/output token counts and the model
> id. If cost must be reported, how should an unknown price be
> represented so records are not fabricated?
>
> *Why:* XJ-06 is the only bounded item where Jcode can produce
> data today (`jcode usage --json` with explicit `price: null` on
> unknown prices) but has no consumer in the absence of a
> registered adapter.
>
> *Expected response:* a field list, or an explicit
> "usage is not part of the adapter contract" ruling.

### Q6 — Transcript round-trip / import format (XJ-05)

> What format does `readNative` consume for transcript import?
> Specifically, does it require JSONL (the shape the Claude / Pi
> adapters read) or will it accept a native JSON store
> (Jcode's current shape at
> `~/.jcode/sessions/session_*_<ms>_<hash>.json`)? Is a
> fixture-based acceptance test required for an import path?
>
> *Why:* Jcode persists JSON, not JSONL; the answer decides
> whether XJ-05 needs a parser or a line-reader, and whether the
> fixture work can be skipped.
>
> *Expected response:* a sample fixture or a format spec; or
> "JSONL only".
