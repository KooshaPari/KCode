#!/usr/bin/env bash
# test-portal-bridge.sh — verify mcp-remote accepts a local stub client
# metadata document and configures the matching OAuth callback.
#
# What this tests:
#   1. The stub CIMD server starts and serves /cimd.json over HTTPS
#   2. mcp-remote (pinned v0.15.1) ACCEPTS the client metadata URL
#      (i.e. it does not silently discard it) and begins OAuth discovery
#   3. mcp-remote uses the 127.0.0.1 callback host that the CIMD
#      registered, and derives a callback port
#
# Why HTTPS (fixed 2026-10-19):
#   mcp-remote's isClientMetadataUrl() requires an https: URL with a
#   non-root pathname. An http:// client metadata URL is SILENTLY IGNORED
#   ("Warning: Ignoring invalid client metadata URL"), so a plain-HTTP stub
#   meant mcp-remote never even considered the document the test claimed
#   to verify. The stub therefore serves a self-signed 127.0.0.1
#   certificate and the test points NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS at it (undici
#   honours that variable).
#
# Why the assertions are NOT "the stub logged a /cimd.json fetch" (fixed
# 2026-10-19):
#   mcp-remote does not download the client metadata document itself. Per
#   SEP-991 it uses the CIMD URL AS THE client_id and asks the
#   AUTHORIZATION SERVER to fetch it; mcp-remote only reads the AS
#   metadata to check client_id_metadata_document_supported === true. The
#   stub therefore never sees a /cimd.json request from mcp-remote. The
#   old assertion passed only because the harness's own curl populated the
#   same log line -- a false positive that hid the HTTP/HTTPS defect
#   entirely.
#
# What this does NOT test:
#   - Completing the OAuth flow (requires the real Spotify Portal)
#   - The real Cloudflare Worker serving the production CIMD
#   - That the AS accepts the client metadata document (needs the real AS)
#   - The allow-list gate (a Spotify/vendor action)
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 = bridge accepted the CIMD URL and configured the 127.0.0.1 callback
#   1 = test infrastructure failure (stub didn't start, no TLS material, the
#       bridge produced no output at all before the timeout, etc.)
#   2 = the bridge did not prove the client-metadata / callback configuration
#
# Bridge timeout (fixed 2026-10-21):
#   The bridge step was hard-coded to 30s. `npx -y mcp-remote@0.15.1` can
#   spend longer than that resolving the package on a cold npx cache, and it
#   writes nothing to stderr while it does. The bridge log was then empty and
#   the assertion below reported exit 2 ("the bridge did not prove the
#   configuration") when in reality the harness never gave the bridge a
#   chance to prove anything. Observed on 2026-10-21: one cold run failed with
#   a 0-byte bridge log, then three warm runs passed in 28s / 19s / 15s, so
#   30s sat right on the boundary. The timeout is now configurable
#   (BRIDGE_TIMEOUT, default 120s) and an empty bridge log is classified as an
#   infrastructure failure (exit 1) instead of a false assertion failure.

#      dynamic registration with a localhost redirect_uri.
#   b. mcp-remote uses --host 127.0.0.1 as the callback hostname.
#   c. mcp-remote derives a callback port and starts the callback server.
#
# Arg order: the server URL must be the FIRST positional arg. Putting
# --transport before it makes mcp-remote parse '--transport' as the URL
# (TypeError: Invalid URL). Fixed 2026-10-19.

# (the stub publishes 127.0.0.1; mcp-remote defaults to localhost on
# non-Windows). Fixed 2026-10-19.
